# ChatProgram

Chat program using JavaFX.

For some reason, double clicking the jar files on Windows does not always work, but the batch files do. The server cannot be run on MacOS as MacOS blocks insecure java applications. I have not yet found a workaround. The client can be run from any OS, however.

Launch Server first (on Windows). Then connect client to the IP address the server displays. If none or multiple are available, go to Network Properties/Preferences to find your IPv4 address. There are sometimes multiple connections available, but only one of them is where the server is hosted.

Enjoy chatting!
